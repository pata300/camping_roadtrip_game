1. Bring the wrench to the lug nuts

/*
	to do this we need to figure out a way to make the wrench clickable
	and have the wrech follow the mouse upon the click

*/

2. We need to be able to choose a lug nut to work on

/*
	need to make the lug nuts clickable once the wrench has been equiped
	this could be done through a boolean; wrenchEquiped = true;
	EX: if (pointerListener = GetComponent(wrench))
			wrenchEquiped = true;

		if (pointerListener = GetComponent(lugNut) && wrenchEquiped)
			//call some kind of function that initiates the rotating part of the minigame

			rotateLug(lugNut);

	*Need to learn pointerListener function
	*Write a rotation function for selected lug nuts
		-Instantiate wrench at the lug nut's tranform
		-Creating a pivot point at the lug nut's tranform
		-Win condition: must be rotated 1080 degrees counterclockwise
	*Lug nut removal animation
	*Destory lugNut
	*Begin process over again until all lug nuts are removed
		-Could be monitored with a For || While loop or through simple sequence method
		-Loops would use less code; would have to figure out a algorithm
		-Could use a counter for each lug nut that is removed. Once the counter hits 5 the sequence would end.
